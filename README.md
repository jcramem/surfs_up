# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round in Oahu by looking at temperatures for the months of June and December. 

## Resources
* Data Sources: SQLAlchemy *hawaii.sqlite* database
* Software: Python 3.7.6; Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results 
The tables below show June and December temperature information in Oahu. An analysis revealed the following:  

* On average, the temperature differences between June and December are likely not as drastic as in other parts of the United States of America. The difference in average high temperature between June (75 degrees) and December (71 degrees) is only four degrees. By contrast, the average high temperature in Los Angeles is 78 degrees in June and 68 degrees in December.  

* In addition, the maximum temperature seen in each month is about the same, 85 degrees in June and 83 in December. This data point, combined with the point made above and the similar small standard deviation suggest that the opportunities for ice cream and surfing will be consistent at different points in the year. 

* One point worth noting is the low temperature readings tend to be noticeably lower in December than in June. So, although daytime temperatures should allow for surfing and ice cream, lower nighttime temperatures in December may summon additional services like hot chocolate or sâ€™mores.

## Summary

Based on the analysis of ride-sharing data, Pyber may want to address the following:

* There are more rides than drivers in rural and suburban areas. To determine if the smaller number of rides in these areas is a function of fewer drivers, add more drivers. If rides increase, revenue increases based on the higher than average fares.
* Consider adding more or scaling back drivers for certain weeks. If drivers are willing to operate out of their typical city type, consider shifting driver areas based on weekly volumes. 
* Consider charging higher fares in urban areas based on sheer market demand.
