# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round in Oahu by looking at temperatures for the months of June and December. 

## Resources
* Data Sources: SQLAlchemy *hawaii.sqlite* database
* Software: Python 3.7.6; Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results 
The tables below show June and December temperature information in Oahu. An analysis revealed the following:  

* On average, the temperature differences between June and December are likely not as drastic as in other parts of the United States of America. The difference in average high temperature between June (75 degrees) and December (71 degrees) is only four degrees. By contrast, the average high temperature in Los Angeles is 78 degrees in June and 68 degrees in December.  

* In addition, the maximum temperature seen in each month is about the same, 85 degrees in June and 83 in December. This data point, combined with the point made above and the similar small standard deviation suggest that the opportunities for ice cream and surfing will be consistent at different points in the year. 

* One point worth noting is the low temperature readings tend to be noticeably lower in December than in June. So, although daytime temperatures should allow for surfing and ice cream, lower nighttime temperatures in December may summon additional services like hot chocolate or sâ€™mores.

## Summary
In sum, the data suggest that a surf and ice cream shop could thrive based on temperature data alone. The typical high is consistent across both months, and both months appear to be warm enough to sustain demand. Still, further analysis of typical a) precipitation and b) hours of sunlight would enhance the sustainability analysis and the potential for year-round business.
